Craft a custom control that scans for AWS Elastic Load Balancer resources across
your connected cloud accounts, detecting any that are "internet-facing".

Precision is criticalâ€”misconfigurations can expose vital infrastructure! 

Secure your environment!

Tips:
When looking for your resources kind find the latest version of your required 
AWS Elastic Load Balancer resource kind in Sysdig and apply it correctly in your
Terraform files.

**BEWARE**: There is a typo in the value returned by the API for this resource kind. 
If you have identified the latest version of this resource kind make sure you use 'v2'
(notice the lowercase) instead of the provided value 'V2' (capital 'V' is a type and
should be lowercase instead).
